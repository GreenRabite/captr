### MVPs

**captr** was developed  under the guidelines of the **"MVP"** feature system (__Minimum Viable Product__) in order to become a viable production level product by the end of short development schedule. This page works double time in that it is high overarching scope of the project as well as a barometer for the developer on what needs to be implemented next. This list will cover **seven** of these points ranging from four core design features and three more relating directly to the functionality of the parent app, _Flickr_. These features are as follows:

1. [ ] New account creation, login, guest/demo login, and authentication
2. [ ] Production level README
3. [ ] Site hosked on Heroku
4. [ ] Users will be able to like, comment, and even favorite their favorite photos and albums in a seamless environment. Users will also have the ability to upload and delete their own pictures. They will not be able to delete other users' pictures unless they have admin status. Users can have many photos, albums, and comments.
5. [ ] Albums
